-- deviation: Lua objects don't have any special properties the way that JS
-- Objects do; this has been modified from the JS, which uses
-- `Object.defineProperties` to ensure that properties are modifiable. In Lua,
-- these operations are as simple as assigning to functions.
-- ROBLOX: use patched console from shared
local console = require(script.Parent:WaitForChild('console'))
-- Helpers to patch console.logs to avoid logging during side-effect free
-- replaying on render function. This currently only patches the object
-- lazily which won't cover if the log function was extracted eagerly.
-- We could also eagerly patch the method.

-- ROBLOX deviation: console.log's name property is checked in SchedulerHostConfig.
-- But since Lua functions don't carry properties, we export this and import it there
-- for a reference equality.
